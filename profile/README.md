# Pesabooks: Collaborative Crypto Investing Made Easy

## Description

Pesabooks leverages the power of decentralized technology and multi-sig wallets to provide a secure, transparent and convenient platform that allows a group of people to save and invest together in the cryptocurrency market. With Pesabooks, users can pool their funds and invest in a variety of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi) assets.

## About

The idea behind Pesabooks originated from a personal experience within a tontine group.

A tontine ( also known as susu, ajo, tanda...) is a traditional form of informal savings and credit system widely used in many cultures around the world. It involves a group of individuals who contribute a fixed amount of money at regular intervals into a common fund.

I wanted an accounting software adapted for tontines that provided real-time financial information accessible to all members, eliminating the need for a group secretary to maintain an Excel file on their laptop. However, [the initial approach](https://github.com/paddyfink/Old-Pesabooks) proved to be impractical, as it burdened the tontine administrator with manual transaction recording.

With this setback in mind, I realized that integrating Pesabooks with a traditional banking system would be costly, and it wouldn't address the fact that a significant portion of the third-world population remains unbanked. However, a breakthrough occurred when I delved into the world of cryptocurrencies.

in 2022, fueled by an interest in crypto, I had an epiphany. I decided to revive the Pesabooks project and shift its focus from being a mere accounting software to a digital platform fueled by cryptocurrencies. The vision was simple: instead of contributing with cash, users could seamlessly contribute online using cryptocurrencies, offering heightened security, faster transactions, and low fees. Pesabooks emerged as a solution that transcends borders, enabling hassle-free money transfers and unlocking the potential for new financial instruments through DeFi.
